\title{micInt: Find microbial interactions}
\description{
This packages utilizes different approaches to find and analyze microbial interactions. 
    The CoNet approach utilzes similarity measures and 
    bootstrapping-permutation methology to find significant correlations between different 
    OTUs in a microbiome data set. The analysis are automized and run in parallel for
    convenient comparison of different similarity measures and methods. The Lotka-Volterra approach is
    based on time series and estimates the Lotka-Volterra coefficients.

\details{
\subsection{Common}{
The starting point for this packages is an OTU table. See description of its format under \code{\link{runAnalysis}}. Note the functions
\code{\link{OTU_stats}} and \code{\link{refine_data}} which are used internally by many of the functions, but
can be useful in user-written code as well.
}

\subsection{CoNet}{
For the CoNet approach, the major function is \code{\link{runAnalysis}} which provides a more or less
complete pipeline. This is a wrapper around the package \code{\link{ccrepe}}. For more advanced users, the lower level
API using \code{\link{ccrepe_analysis}} might be preferable. In addition, there are many auxillary functions
such as generating interaction tables (\code{\link{create_interaction_table}}), writing them to file (\code{\link{write.interaction_table}})
and making diagnostic plots of the tables (\code{\link{autoplot.interaction_table}}).
}

\subsection{Lotka-Volterra}{
This approach is based on
The Lotka-Volterra systems are generated by \code{\link{integralSystem}}
For the time being, \code{\link{ridge_fit}} is the only function available to solve
the systems (works even if they are over- or underdetermined) by ridge regularization.
The regularization parameters have to be determined somehow, this is where \code{\link{cv.LV}} comes
into play. It performs cross-validation in order to pick the best regularization parameters.
Finally, the estimated coefficients can be put into the differential equations again in order
to predict future dynamics of a microbial community using \code{\link{predict.LV}}
