Description: This packages utilizes different approaches to find and analyze microbial interactions. 
    The CoNet approach utilzes similarity measures and 
    bootstrapping-permutation methology to find significant correlations between different 
    OTUs in a microbiome data set. The analysis are automized and run in parallel for
    convenient comparison of different similarity measures and methods. The Lotka-Volterra approach is
    based on time series and estimates the Lotka-Volterra coefficients.
